InstaCheck: The Instagram Follower and Following Analyzer 


InstaCheck is a free, simple, and secure web application designed to help you analyze your Instagram following and followers lists offline.


Upload your two data files (Followers and Following) to quickly find out:


Non-Followers (Unfollow Targets): Users you follow who do not follow you back.


Potential Follow-Backs: Users who follow you, but you have not followed back yet.



üîí Security & Privacy
InstaCheck is completely client-side.

This means the JSON files you upload are NEVER transmitted to any server.

All processing and comparison are done instantly within your own web browser.

Your data remains private and secure on your device.

üöÄ How to Use
The only thing you need is your Instagram data download package. Follow the steps below, and then upload the two files to the tool.

Step 1: Download Your Instagram Data
        
Go to your Instagram Profile (via the app or web).
        
Navigate to Your Activity > Download Your Information (or search for "Download Your Data").

Enter the email where you want to receive the files.

When prompted for the format, select JSON and confirm the download request. (Note: Instagram may take up to 48 hours to prepare the download link.)

Download the ZIP file you receive via email and extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

Step 2: Locate the Files.

Inside the extracted data folder, navigate to the followers_and_following directory.

You will find these two files which you need for the analyzer:

followers_1.json (The list of people who follow you)

following.json (The list of people you follow)

Step 3: Upload and Analyze!

Open the [InstaCheck live website URL here].

Drag and drop the followers_1.json file into the "Drop Your Followers File" box.

Drag and drop the following.json file into the "Drop Your Following File" box.

Click either the "Find Non-Followers" or "Find Potential Follow-Backs" button to view the results instantly.
